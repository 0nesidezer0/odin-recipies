        <h2>Desctiption</h2> </p>
   <p>The second time I made this I added in about 2 tbsp of fresh rosemary and thyme, as well as garlic powder. The crust is soooo much better. I also just made the regular recipe, and since I don't have a pizza stone, put it with a little cornmeal on a cookie sheet with roasted chicken, slice red onions, peppers and tomatoes. I ate tooooooo much. First revew: I have a mixed review for this, partially because of my choices, partially because I think it can be made better. First, I made this for 18 portions, and it was just too much crust. I would have liked it better if it were thinner. This is a conversation my hubby and I go through all the time. He prefers a deep dish, and I prefer a thinner crust. I also thought the flavor was bland, and the second time added garlic powder, fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden, and a bit more salt. That was better.</p>
    
   <p> I am currently looking for the best pizza crust, as I live in Guatemala and finding good pizza is a lost cause unless it is from my oven.</p>
